Circular Linked List 

Circular Linked List 	

The Josephus Problem is a famous mathematical puzzle that goes back to ancient times. There are many stories to go with the puzzle. One is that Josephus was one of a group of Jews and the group (number of people in group is n) was about to be captured by the Romans. Rather than be enslaved, Jews chose to commit suicide. They arranged themselves in a circle and, starting at a certain person, started counting off around the circle. Every mth person (the counting off number is m) had to leave the circle and commit suicide. When a person drops out of the circle, the counting starts again from the person who was on his right (assuming you go around clockwise). 
Josephus decided that he didn’t want to die, so he arranged the rules so he would be the last person left. The problem is made much more complicated because the circle shrinks as the counting continues. 

Implement a Java program that uses a circular linked list to model this problem. 

•	Inputs are the number of people in the circle (n) and the number used for counting off (m). 
•	Here we assume that the counting starts with the first person.
